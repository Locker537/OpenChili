Here is the basic (LEGENDARY) recipe.
As with any good chili, you have the power to alter it as you see fit...

-- INGREDIENTS --
-----------------
5.5 lbs ground beef
1 large onion
3-4 cloves garlic, pressed
1-2 habanero pepper
4-5 large poblano peppers
8-10 serrano or cayenne peppers
6-8 chipolte peppers
2-3 jalapenos
54oz canned red kidney beans
20oz Hunts whole tomatoes in tomato juice, juice and all
16oz beer
1.5 tbl brown sugar
2 tsp Mexican oregano
2.5 tbl cumin
1.5 tbl kosher salt
3 tsp black pepper
1.5 tsp cayenne pepper powder
------------------

You can adjust the pepper quantities to how hot you want it.

Brown the ground beef and drain the grease.
Add in all the seasonings and stir in.
Add in everything else.
Keep it at a temp where it is just barely bubbling and let it cook for
at least 3 hours with the lid on, stirring occasionally.

This makes roughtly 6 quarts of awesome.
